lens-simple
==================

`Lens-Simple` makes it easier to use the combinators and elementary lenses and traversals from the original 'van Laarhoven' lens library: Russell O'Connor's [`lens-family`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core) package. Despite its simplicity, this package has a rather complicated structure. The `zoom` preferred here is from `Lens.Family.State.Strict`. `makeLenses` and `makeTraversals` & co are re-exported from Dan Burton's  [`lens-family-th`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-th).
