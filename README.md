lens-simple
==================

This just re-exports the combinators and elementary lenses and traversals from the original 'van Laarhoven' lens library, Russell O'Connor's [`lens-family`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-core) package, including `Lens.Family.State.Strict`, and the corresponding TH module from Dan Burton's [`lens-family-th`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens-family-th) so you can `makeLenses` and `makeTraversals` automatically.
